Status post hysterectomy secondary to uterine fibroids.,PROCEDURES:,  Telemetry monitoring.,HISTORY FINDINGS HOSPITAL COURSE: , The patient was originally hospitalized on 04/26/07, secondary to dizziness and disequilibrium.  Extensive workup during her first hospitalization was all negative, but a prominent feature was her very blunted affect and real anhedonia.  She was transferred briefly to Psychiatry, however, on the second day in Psychiatry, she became very orthostatic and was transferred acutely back to the medicine.  She briefly was on Cymbalta; however, this was discontinued when she was transferred back.  She was monitored back medicine for 24 hours and was given intravenous fluids and these were discontinued.  She was able to maintain her pressures then was able to ambulate without difficulty.  We had wanted to pursue workup for possible causes for autonomic dysfunction; however, the patient was not interested in remaining in the hospital anymore and left really against our recommendations.,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:,1.  CellCept - 500 mg twice a daily.,2.  Cyclosporine - 25 mg in the morning and 15 mg in the evening.,3.  Prednisone - 5 mg once daily.,4.  Hydralazine - 10 mg four times a day.,5.  Pantoprazole - 40 mg once daily.,6.  Glipizide - 5 mg every morning.,7.

After intravenous sedation was administered a retrobulbar block consisting of 2% Xylocaine with 0.75% Marcaine and Wydase was administered to the right eye without difficulty.  The patient's right eye was prepped and draped in a sterile ophthalmic fashion and the procedure begun.  A wire lid speculum was inserted into the right eye and a 360-degree conjunctival peritomy was performed at the limbus.  The 4 rectus muscles were looped and isolated using 2-0 silk suture.  The retinal periphery was then inspected via indirect ophthalmoscopy.,\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 808,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"list\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 6,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 26,\n        \"samples\": [\n          8,\n          13,\n          9\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 27,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

She was seen in the preoperative holding area where the surgery was discussed accordingly and markings were applied.  Full informed consent noted and chemistries were on her chart and preoperative evaluation was negative.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operative room under satisfaction, and she was placed supine on the OR table.  Administered general endotracheal anesthesia followed by sterile prep and drape at the patient's face and abdomen.  This included the neck accordingly.,Two platysmal sling application and operating headlight were utilized.  Hemostasis was controlled with the pinpoint cautery along with suction Bovie cautery.,The first procedure was performed was that of a quadrilateral blepharoplasty.  Markers were applied to both upper lids in symmetrical fashion.  The skin was excised from the right upper lid first followed by appropriate muscle resection.  Minimal fat removed from the medial upper portion of the eyelid.  Hemostasis was controlled with the quadrilateral tip needle; closure with a running 7-0 nylon suture.  Attention was then turned to the lower lid.  A classic skin muscle flap was created accordingly.  Fat was resected from the middle, medial, and lateral quadrant.  The fat was allowed to open drain the arcus marginalis for appropriate contour.  Hemostasis was controlled with the pinpoint cautery accordingly.  Skin was redraped with a conservative amount resected.  Running closure with 7-0 nylon was accomplished without difficulty.  The exact same procedure was repeated on the left upper and lower lid.,After completion of this portion of the procedure, the lag lid was again placed in the eyes.  Eye mass was likewise clamped.  Attention was turned to her face with plans for cervical facial rhytidectomy portion of the procedure.  The right face was first operated.  It was injected with a 0.25% Marcaine 1:200,000 adrenaline.  A submental incision was created followed by suction lipectomy and very minimal amounts of ***** in 3 mm and 2-mm suction cannula.  She had minimal subcutaneous extra fat as noted.  Attention was then turned to the incision which was in the temporal hairline in curvilinear fashion following the pretragal incision to the postauricular sulcus and into and along the post-occipital hairline.  The flap was elevated without difficulty with various facelift scissors.  Hemostasis was controlled again with a pinpoint cautery as well as suction Bovie cautery.,The exact same elevation of skin flap was accomplished on the left face followed by the anterosuperior submental space with approximately 4-cm incision.  Rectus plication in the midline with a running 4-0 Mersilene was followed by some transaction of the platysma above the hairline with coagulation, cutting, and cautery.  The submental incision was closed with a running 7-0 nylon over 5-0 Monocryl.,Attention was then turned to closure of the bilateral facelift incisions after appropriate SMAS plication.  The left side of face was first closed followed by interrupted SMAS plication utilizing 4-0 wide Mersilene.  The skin was draped appropriately and appropriate tissue was resected.  A 7-mm 9-0 French drain was utilized accordingly prior to closure of the skin with interrupted 4-0 Monocryl in the post-occipital region followed by running 5-0 nylon in the postauricular surface.  Preauricular interrupted 5-0 Monocryl was followed by running 7-0 nylon.  The hairline temporal incision was closed with running 5-0 nylon.  The exact same closure was accomplished on the right side of the face with a same size 7-mm French drain.,The patient's dressing consisted of Adaptic Polysporin ointment followed by Kerlix wrap with a 3-inch Ace.,The lips and mouth were sterilely prepped and draped accordingly after application of the head drape dressing as described.  Suction lipectomy was followed in the abdomen with sterile conditions were prepped and draped accordingly.  Approximately 2.5 to 3 cc of autologous fat was injected into the upper lip of the remaining cutaneous line with blunt tip dissector after having washed the fat with saline accordingly.  Tuberculin syringes were utilized on the injection utilizing a larger blunt tip needle for the actual injection procedure.  The incision site was closed with 7-0 nylon.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition with Foley catheter in position.,The patient will be admitted for overnight short stay through the cosmetic package procedure.  She will be discharged in the morning.,Estimated blood loss was less than 75 cc.  No complications noted, and the patient tolerated the procedure well.\",\n          \"physical medicine - rehab, emg, nerve conduction study, nerve conduction studies, needle emg, electrical study, neuropathy, ulnar neuropathy, median neuropathy, severely attenuated evoked response, normal evoked response amplitude, attenuated evoked response amplitude, median motor distal latency, motor distal latency, abductor pollicis, pollicis brevis, dorsal interosseous, carpal tunnel, conduction, emg/nerve, needle,NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES:,  Bilateral ulnar sensory responses are absent.  Bilateral median sensory distal latencies are prolonged with a severely attenuated evoked response amplitude.  The left radial sensory response is normal and robust.  Left sural response is absent.  Left median motor distal latency is prolonged with attenuated evoked response amplitude.  Conduction velocity across the forearm is mildly slowed.  Right median motor distal latency is prolonged with a normal evoked response amplitude and conduction velocity.  The left ulnar motor distal latency is prolonged with a severely attenuated evoked response amplitude both below and above the elbow.  Conduction velocities across the forearm and across the elbow are prolonged.  Conduction velocity proximal to the elbow is normal.  The right median motor distal latency is normal with normal evoked response amplitudes at the wrist with a normal evoked response amplitude at the wrist.  There is mild diminution of response around the elbow.  Conduction velocity slows across the elbow.  The left common peroneal motor distal latency evoked response amplitude is normal with slowed conduction velocity across the calf and across the fibula head.  F-waves are prolonged.,NEEDLE EMG: , Needle EMG was performed on the left arm and lumbosacral and cervical paraspinal muscles as well as middle thoracic muscles using a disposable concentric needle.  It revealed spontaneous activity in lower cervical paraspinals, left abductor pollicis brevis, and first dorsal interosseous muscles.  There were signs of chronic reinnervation in triceps, extensor digitorum communis, flexor pollicis longus as well first dorsal interosseous and abductor pollicis brevis muscles.,IMPRESSION: , This electrical study is abnormal.  It reveals the following:,1.  A sensory motor length-dependent neuropathy consistent with diabetes.,2.  A severe left ulnar neuropathy.  This is probably at the elbow, although definitive localization cannot be made.,3.  Moderate-to-severe left median neuropathy.  This is also probably at the carpal tunnel, although definitive localization cannot be made.,4.  Right ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, mild.,5.  Right median neuropathy at the wrist consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome, moderate.,6.  A left C8 radiculopathy (double crush syndrome).,7.
